    Week One: Introduction 👋
<p>Lecture Notes: <a href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2014/02/the-3-minute-story">Available Here</a>.</p>

- **🎯 Primary Module Aim:** 
  *The central aim of this module is help students attain the ability to take complex data, process it and extract value from it through visualisation.*

- **🤔 Consider The Problem** 
We are not machines; The unimaginably vast arrary of arbitrary data sets that exist are completely beyond our comprehension - Every single computer interaction leaves a data trail, from the exact moment and amount of a Visa Card payment to the constant, precise recording of each Dublin Bus GPS position. It all leaves a data trail. Eventually someone needs to package this data mess into bus timetables, actionable insights or quarterly spending reports. The adage *"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it"* holds true here more than anywhere.

- **🤨 Functions of Visualisations?** 
  - **Record**: store information.
  - **Analyze**: support reasoning about information.
    - Process and calculate
    - Reason about data
    - Feedback and interaction
  - **Communicate**: convey information to others.
    - Share and persuade
    - Collaborate and revise
    - Emphasize important aspects of data

- **📝 Why Do We Need Visualisation?**
  - The challenge is to create effective and engaging visualizations that are appropriate to the data.
  
  - Well-designed visual representations can replace cognitive calculations with simple perceptual inferences and improve comprehension, memory, and decision making.

  - By making data more accessible and appealing, visual representations may also help engage more diverse audiences in exploration and analysis

- **🔨 Building Effective Visualisation**
  Incorporate the Following:
    - **Perceptual Psychology**
    - **Cognitive Science**
    - **Graphic Design**
    - **Visual art**
- 🔧 Software Tools available?
  - Jupyter 🪐
  - Tableau Public 📊
  - R Programming & Visualisations 🧑‍💻

##### 📁 Lab Notes:
* The Big Idea, Elevator Pitch & The Three Minute Story.
* It's Far Easier to Tell a rambling spiel, the art is in the well crafted, clear & concise call to action
* *“I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time”* - Blaise Pascal
 ##### 💡 The Big Idea? What is it? 

  1. Articulate your **Point of View**.
  2. Convey **What is at Stake** to the Audience should they accept or decline.
  3. And; It must be a **complete sentence**, nothing more nor less.
- So What is the point of this exercise? Illustrating the value of making your concept universally understandable. Much like will will try to make our **Data** accessible through **Visualisation** going forward.
